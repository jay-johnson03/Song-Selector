            The first day of testing went well. I was able to complete 
            all the tasks given to me without any issues. I worked very hard. I also took a 
            short 10 minute nap in between my studies to be refreshed for the next task.
            <p> I worked on Data Structures yesterday and <em>finally</em> understood the underlying
                concepts he was talking about. <strong> Thank goodness.</strong> 
            </p>
            <p> I also learned how to use GitHub and GitHub Copilot. It's a really cool tool that helps
                you write code faster. I think it will be very useful in the future (curtesy of ChatGPT).

            I'm excited to see what the future holds for me. I have a lot of plans for
             the next few months. <p> I had <strong>ChatGPT</strong> write that sentence..</p>
        </p>
        <p> I turned on CoPilot just for this section cus I had no clue what to write. 
        <p> I think it's a cool tool, but I don't want to rely on it too much. </p>
