            The first day of testing went well. I was able to complete 
            all the tasks given to me without any issues. I worked very hard. I also took a 
            short 10 minute nap in between my studies to be refreshed for the next task.
            <p> I worked on Data Structures yesterday and <em>finally</em> understood the underlying
                concepts he was talking about. <strong> Thank goodness.</strong>
